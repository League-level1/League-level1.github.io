<h1>Intro to Getters and Setters</h1>

<p class="normal">

    <h3>Part 1</h3>

1: Create a class called Taco, then add 2 private String member variables for the meat and sauce.<br>
<br>
2: Create methods  getMeat() and getSauce() that return the member variables.<br>
<br>
3: Create methods setMeat(String meat) amd setSauce(String sauce) that set the values of the members variables to the values passed in the method parameters. <br>
<br>

    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    
4. Create a Person class, with 2 member variables - name and superpower.<br>
<br>
5. Using the pattern in Part 1, add getter and setter methods for the member variables of the Person class.<br>
<br>
6. Now, make a Runner class that creates 3 different people, sets their superpowers, and prints the value returned by the default toString() method. <br>
<br>
7. Override the default toString() method by implementing a toString() method on the Person class that returns "&lt;name&gt; has mad &lt;superpower&gt; skills".
